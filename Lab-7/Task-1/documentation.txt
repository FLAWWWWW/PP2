import pygame - this is of course needed to access the PyGame framework.

pygame.init() - This kicks things off. It initializes all the modules required for PyGame.

pygame.display.set_mode((width, height)) - This will launch a window of the desired size. The return value is a Surface object which is the object you will 
perform graphical operations on. This will be discussed later.

pygame.event.get() - this empties the event queue. If you do not call this, the windows messages will start to pile up and your game will become 
unresponsive in the opinion of the operating system.

pygame.QUIT - This is the event type that is fired when you click on the close button in the corner of the window.

pygame.display.flip() - PyGame is double-buffered. This swaps the buffers. All you need to know is that this call is required in order for 
any updates that you make to the game screen to become visible.
